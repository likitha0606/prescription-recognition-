# Medical Prescription Recognition System

## Introduction

The Medical Prescription Recognition System is a comprehensive solution designed to automate the process of extracting critical information from handwritten medical prescriptions. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the system identifies, classifies, and extracts essential components from prescriptions, such as patient details, prescribed medications, dosage instructions, and more.

## Key Features
- Object Detection
- Text Recognition
- Classification
- Data Extraction

## Technologies Used
- YOLO: For object detection to localize regions of interest within prescriptions.
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): For classification tasks to identify and label specific components of the prescription.
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition): For text recognition and extraction from handwritten content.
- Python: The primary programming language used to integrate all components.
- Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Tesseract, and NumPy.

## How to Run the Project
- Clone the repository to your local machine.

- Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

- Run the script using the command: python main.py.

- Upload or input a prescription image to begin processing.
